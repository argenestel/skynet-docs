# User Guide

Welcome to the SkynetXBT User Guide. This section provides non-technical documentation for using SkynetXBT flows and agents. Here you'll find information about flow inputs, outputs, and how to interact with the system.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Flow Catalog**: Complete list of available flows with their capabilities
- **Input/Output Specifications**: What each flow expects and returns
- **Usage Examples**: Practical examples for each flow
- **Configuration Guides**: How to set up and configure flows for your needs

## Quick Start for Users

### Using the Flows Store CLI

The easiest way to interact with SkynetXBT is through the Flows Store:

```bash
# Install the flows store
npm install -g @skynetxbt/flows-store

# See all available flows
npm run flows list

# Run a flow with a message
npm run flows run <flow-name> --message "Your message here"
```

### Understanding Flow Execution

All flows follow the same basic pattern:

1. **Input**: You provide a message or query
2. **Processing**: The flow processes your request
3. **Output**: You receive results in text, JSON, or other formats
